## DePaul's Computer Science Society (CSS)

### Definition
DePaul's CSS is a group of students that are interested in computer science. The goal of this club is to promote involvement outside of the classroom.
The way that we do this is by promoting hackathons, holding 2-credit hour class, and organizing workshops, talks, and office visits.

### Size
On Facebook, there are about 460 CSS members. This consists of current students, staff/faculty, and alumni.
Roughly 25 students attend the weekly meetings. I'm hoping to increase the number of active members by 5 - 10.
Historically, there have not been many active members that would attend the weekly meetings.

I believe that with the changes that were made for this year have increased attendance rates because us board members
have tried to put together workshops/talks that are beneficial and relevant to the students.
These workshops and talks vary from learning how to make a basic Rails app to interview preparation to learning more about various companies.

### Resources
We have weekly meetings, a Facebook group, and Slack team.
Special events are shared in all platforms. CSS specific events are held in meetings.

### Accessibility
Meetings are held after most classes are over with (Wednesdays at 5pm). People that have night classes are able to attend up to 30 minutes.
Our online platforms are accessible to anyone that has a Facebook profile or `@mail.depaul.edu` email.
If someone prefers to use their personal email over their school email, we send out special invites to Slack.
The CDM building has elevators and wide doorways for those with disabilities.

### Interests
Even though it is the Computer Science Society, members aren't required to major in CS.
In fact, we have a variety of majors ranging from business to animation!
While we focus mainly on CS-specific topics, we make sure to listen to any and all requests.
For example, many people requested tutoring sessions and resume reviews, which we have started earlier this year.


### Goals
People join CSS to learn more outside of their classes, make new friends, get help (e.g., tutoring, preparing for interviews, fixing their laptop, etc.),
find hackathon team members, and more. Members are passionate about CS and want to get more out of simply attending their classes.
If someone isn't getting what they want out of the community, they are more than welcome to make a request to one of the board members.

### Location
CSS meets on Wednesdays in the CDM building. We tried to find a day and time where majority of people would be able to come in by taking a poll.
The room that we have at the moment can comfortably fit up to 40 people and is accessible to everyone. Since the room is provided by DePaul, it's completely free to use.
With DePaul's UPass (unlimited free rides on the CTA), students are able to easily travel to CDM or to any place where a special event is being held as long as it's in the city.
At the moment, we do not provide snacks or drinks, but are looking into getting funding in order to provide it in the future quarters.
Members can easily get food or drinks at one of the many places nearby (e.g., Starbucks, Potbelly's, Chipotle, Jimmy John's, etc.).
If members can't attend the meetings, we share important information on the Slack team and Facebook group.
Members can also reach out to anyone for help through the online platforms (e.g., asking for homework help, seeing who's attending a certain hackathon, or sharing cool tech info).

### Culture
We're definitely a very welcoming community. Anyone is able to join!
Some business students have joined to partner up with members to create apps.
We also allow members to share any ideas that they may have for a meeting/workshop.
If there is a disagreement, we follow DePaul's rules of reporting more serious conducts to the dean.
If there is a disagreement amongst board members, we simply put things to a vote.
